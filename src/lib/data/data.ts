  "I’m someone who values communication and cares about understanding the meaning and purpose behind each project. I believe that knowing the reason behind things makes every solution smarter, more consistent, and meaningful.",

  "I’m constantly exploring new trends and technologies, and whenever something catches my interest, I don't hesitate to dive in and learn more about it. Outside of programming, I have a strong interest in philosophy and psychology. I also enjoy spending my free time playing game, reading books, or creating music.",
